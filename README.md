# Automatek
Cellular Automata visualizator that runs on the terminal.

The project is entirely for learning purposes and it is based on [Robert Heaton's Game of Life article](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/).

## Use
Run the code on the terminal by using
```
$ python main.py
```
### Controls
In menus, move between rows with up/down arrow keys. Press the enter key to interact.

In display mode (when the automata is running) press the same arrow keys to adjust the velocity of the visualizor. Press enter to go back to menus.

Keep in mind that the project is still in development, so expect some bugs. Also, the 'Make your own automata' option is not implemented yet.

Enjoy!
