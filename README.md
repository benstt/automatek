# Automatek
Cellular Automata visualizator that runs on the terminal.

The project is entirely for learning purposes and it is based on [Robert Heaton's Game of Life article](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/).

## Use
Run the code on the terminal by using
```
$ python main.py
```
### Controls
In menus, move between rows with `up/down` arrow keys. Press the `enter` key to interact.

In display mode (when the automata is running) press the same `arrow keys` to adjust the velocity of the visualizer. Press `enter` to go back to menus.

Keep in mind that the project is still in development, so expect some bugs. Also, the 'Make your own automata' option is not implemented yet.

Enjoy!
